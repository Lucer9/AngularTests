# Simple Angular Search Listing


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.5.  
Used [TMDB API ](https://www.themoviedb.org) for the mock data, and even though the API comes with searching endpoints, it was all done in the frontend.
All the CSS was handmade from a personal design    
A demo can be found [here](https://peaceful-kowalevski-a35e88.netlify.app/)    

**Note**
>The demo has to get local data, because the API request is on HTTP while the site is on HTTPS


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.



## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
